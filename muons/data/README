Muon spectra from heavy flavor decays from
http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~cacciari/fonll/fonllform.html

These are in the run2 and run3 directories

Main requirement is abs(eta)<1.
For other details see the text files.

For the total xsection, multiply by 2 (most likely, TBC)

b-to-mu.txt .pdf .root

pp -> b -> mu

b-to-c-to-mu.txt .pdf .root
---------------------------
pp -> b -> c -> mu

c-to-mu.txt .pdf .root
----------------------
pp -> c -> mu

-----------------
Output of command
hadd b-incl-to-mu.root b-to-mu.root b-to-c-to-mu.root
This adds the uncertainties linearly, as they probably should,
and is the root file to be used for the generation of all
muons from b decays (including the cascade b->c->mu)
